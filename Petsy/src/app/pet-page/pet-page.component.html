      This beautiful whippet mix girl is Norah, and she is approx 2 years old 😍
      <br />
      <br />
      Norah was left into a local dog pound and she has since joined us.
      Unfortunately, due to being quite thin, we have put off her spay surgery
      until she is a little more at herself, so we will be working on that for
      the next week or 2 ✔️
      <br />
      <br />
      She is a very sweet, timid girl, a real lady, and we look forward to
      learning more about her during her time with us ❤️‍🩹
      <br />
      <br />
      Norah is also in need of foster, so if you can help , please get in touch
      <br />
      <br />
      ✔️ Welcome Norah ❤️
